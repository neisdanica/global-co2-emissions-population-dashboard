# global-co2-emissions-population-dashboard

## Description:

This repository contains the code for my final project in data visualization: a Dash app that explores Global CO2 Emissions and Population Trends. The interactive dashboard provides visual insights into the relationship between population growth and CO2 emissions over time, helping to understand global trends and their potential implications.

## Features:

### Data Sources: 

CO2 emissions and population datasets from Our World in Data. https://github.com/owid/co2-data 

### Visualizations:

Line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots to explore trends.

### Interactivity:

Filters for selecting specific time periods, and countries.
Hover tooltips and dynamic updates for detailed exploration.

## Technologies:

Dash: Framework for creating the interactive web application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Plotly: For creating high-quality, interactive visualizations.

This project demonstrates the application of data visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights and is a part of my journey in data analytics and visualization.
